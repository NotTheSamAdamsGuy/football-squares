# Football Squares

A standalone app for serving up a Super Bowl Squares board.

## Overview

Super Bowl Squares is a betting game associated with the NFL's Super Bowl. It consists of a 10x10 grid where rows and columns are numbered 0 to 9, though they are often randomized to make things fair for all participants. One of the Super Bowl competitors is listed across the top of the columns and the other along the rows. 

Each square in the grid relates to the score at a significant juncture in the game, either at the end of a certain quarter, half or the full game. To play, all a bettor needs to do is pick a square they think will correspond with the right-most digits of the score at one of these junctures.
